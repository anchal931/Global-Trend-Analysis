# 🌍 GlobalTrends: Exploratory Data Analysis on Gapminder Dataset

## 📊 Overview

**GlobalTrends** is a data-driven project by a leading analytics firm committed to understanding the evolving global landscape. This repository contains an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Gapminder dataset to uncover patterns in:

- 🌐 GDP per Capita  
- 🏥 Life Expectancy  
- 👥 Population Growth  

The goal is to analyze how key global indicators like **GDP per capita**, **life expectancy**, and **population** have changed across countries and regions over time, and what they reveal about development and inequality.
